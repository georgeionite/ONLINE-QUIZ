## Description

This project is a coding quiz web application that allows users to test their knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. The quiz is timed, and users are presented with multiple-choice questions. Incorrect answers result in a time penalty. At the end of the quiz, users can enter their initials to save their score.

## User Story

As a coding boot camp student, I desire to engage in a timed quiz focused on JavaScript fundamentals, where high scores are stored. This enables me to assess my progress in comparison to my peers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A start button that, when clicked, starts a timer and displays the first question.
- Questions with buttons for each answer.
- When an answer is clicked, the next question appears.
- If the answer clicked is incorrect, time is subtracted from the clock.
- The quiz ends when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
- When the game ends, it displays the user's score and allows them to save their initials and score.
